- What about a series of 3d cubes that flip continuously? 
- What about a sphere? Doesn't that sound sensible?

I've had a think and I think the best mixture between something that is programmatic and thematic is a book series 
It would be a series of open books. If you scrolled on the x-y axis the camera would move left and right. 
If you scrolled on the z axis it would flip the page 

Yeah this is definitely the way to do it. It's the best mixture of programmatic and thematic. 
I'm also reasonably sure you could do this by importing book animations. You could create like four or five books animations 
They would be the book moving left, right, up, down and page flipping. 
This also feels programmatic because all you would need to do is treat the pages as divs and match the transition speed for the book 
 
I think there's two things that would add a lot of realism to this: 
- first adding ease in, ease out and having it matched well. Having realistic animation would sell this as a book 
- second is a slight tilt on the viewpoint. If you could make it not look like you were looking perfectly head on but were looking from a slight angle that would be very helpful.
- One thing that would really sell it would be warped text. If you could warp the text like it's on a page that would be very good

I think navigation should be - left arrow, right arrow, page flip 
This is probably left key, right key, spacebar with a navigation as well
